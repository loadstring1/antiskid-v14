# antiskid-v14

help antiskid v14 improve today by making pull requests

todo (if somebody cares enough to help with it):
1. Make ;bans command work and show everyone whos banned on antiskid's banlist via gui or smth lol
2. Somehow convert all instances to file system too and not only scripts
3. Help with type checker making errors when i do smth like script.Modules in AntiSkidStarter (im clueless and im new to this)
4. Fix all stupid type checker errors
5. Make github actions that automaticially update the module on roblox.com (build from source then upload new version to roblox immediately on commit)
^ if not possible at least make it so github actions put new module under github releases
6. Improve buildFromSource because its kinda dogshit only updating script sources and does not re-create all these instances that antiskid has
